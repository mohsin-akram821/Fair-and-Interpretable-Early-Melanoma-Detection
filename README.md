# Fair-and-Interpretable-Early-Melanoma-Detection
Fairness-aware and interpretable deep learning framework developed for early melanoma detection using ensemble Vision Transformers (ViTs). The approach incorporates demographic-aware modeling and gradient-based explainable AI (XAI) techniques to ensure accurate, transparent, and equitable clinical predictions.
